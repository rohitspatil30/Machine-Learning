    "\n",
    "Underfitting and overfitting are two common phenomena that occur in machine learning models during the training process.\n",
    "\n",
    "Underfitting occurs when a model is too simple to capture the underlying patterns and relationships present in the training data. It often leads to high bias and low variance. In other words, an underfit model fails to learn from the training data and performs poorly on both the training and testing datasets. Underfitting can be caused by using an overly simple model or insufficient training data.\n",

    "2. **OVERFITTING**\n",
    "\n",
    "Overfitting, on the other hand, occurs when a model becomes too complex and starts to memorize the training data instead of learning the underlying patterns. This results in low bias and high variance. An overfit model performs exceedingly well on the training data but fails to generalize to unseen data, leading to poor performance on the testing dataset. Overfitting can be caused by using a complex model, having too many features, or having insufficient training data relative to the model's complexity.\n",
    "\n",
    "Both underfitting and overfitting are undesirable as they indicate a lack of generalization ability in the model. The goal in machine learning is to find the right balance between the two, known as the optimal trade-off, where the model can generalize well to unseen data. Techniques such as regularization, cross-validation, and feature selection can help mitigate the issues of underfitting and overfitting.\n",
